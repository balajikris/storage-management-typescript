# Getting Started with Azure Storage Resource Provider in Typescript

This sample shows how to manage your storage account using the Azure Storage Resource Provider using Typescript. The Storage Resource Provider is a client library for working with the storage accounts in your Azure subscription. Using the client library, you can create a new storage account, read its properties, list all storage accounts in a given subscription or resource group, read and regenerate the storage account keys, and delete a storage account.

**Note**: This sample requires a future version of azure packages that is still work in progress.
See this [PR](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/2084). Once this changed is merged and new versions of the packages are published to npm, just update the package versions in package.json to make this sample run.
